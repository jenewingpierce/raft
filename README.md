This project is still underway---its a nutraceutical start up run by a physician and a holistic nutrition practitioner. They wanted to enter the nutraceutical space and the private virtual consultation space but are leery of the saturation in the market. They had a vague idea for an app.  

I conducted initial secondary research on the problem space, executed a screener survey, and recruited from the survey for interviews. The interviewees are all women at the stakeholder's request because initial secondary research indicated that the majority of dollars spent were spent with women in control of the spending and driving the decisions. I suggested that we include one non-female identifying subject but the stakeholders declined.  

I have included here the research presentation to the client and the interview script, with research notes. This led to some loose concepting where we came up with the idea of an app and online wizard that are integrated with each other.  The wizard generates leads and encourages the download of the app and vice versa. 

Currently, we have moved beyond discovery toward ideation, and low-fi wires. I'm conducting card sort tests to validate the site map we built out.  I don't have those artifacts yet.
